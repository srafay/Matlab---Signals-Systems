The signal with sampling rate 100 samples per second is recovered while the signals with
sampling rates with 20 samples per second and 10 samples per second are not properly reconstructed.
This is due due the reason that in the first case sampling rate=100 is greater than Nyquist Rate which is
equal to 2*Fmaxfrequency=2*10=20 and in the second case it is equal , and in the third it is less than 20
